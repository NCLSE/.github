## Preface
NCLSE was originally named _Netamiral_. However, due to being shorter and easier to remember, the name was changed to NCLSE which stands for **Network, Cloud, Linux, and Security Education**. However, even though the name of this organization is taken from several scopes in the IT Operations field, in the future it is possible that there will be material related to programming and other IT fields.
